## Installation

The preferred way of installation is through Composer.
If you don't have Composer you can get it here: https://getcomposer.org/

You also should install the Composer Asset Plugin to handle NPM and Bower assets:
```
$ composer global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.4"
```

Or you can make use of Asset Packagist: <https://asset-packagist.org/>

To install the package add the following to the ```require``` section of your composer.json:
```
"require": {
    "uomocon/materialize": "*"
},
```

## Usage

To load the Materialize CSS files integrate the MaterializeAsset into your app.
Two ways to achieve this is to register the asset in the main layout:

```php
// @app/views/layouts/main.php

\uomocon\materialize\assets\MaterializeAsset::register($this);
// further code
```

or as a dependency in your app wide AppAsset.php

```php
// @app/assets/AppAsset.php

public $depends = [
    'uomocon\materialize\assets\MaterializeAsset',
    // more dependencies
];
```
